# 🧠 Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning (XGBoost & ANN)

![Project Thumbnail](./Copilot_20250910_125408.png)

This project explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on medical and lifestyle factors.
It leverages XGBoost for gradient boosting and ANNs for deep learning, comparing their performance on a structured health dataset.

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values

- Encode categorical features

- Normalize/standardize numeric features

- Handle class imbalance (oversampling/undersampling if needed)

### 2. Models

**Baseline Machine Learning Models**

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree Classifier

- Random Forest Classifier

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Ensemble & Boosting Models**

- MaxVoting

- Bagging Classifier

- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

**Deep Learning**

- ANN (Artificial Neural Network) with multiple layers

- Hyperparameter tuning (layers, neurons, activation functions, dropout, etc.)

### 3. Evaluation

- Accuracy

- Precision

- Recall

- F1-score

- ROC-AUC

- Confusion Matrix
  
- Model comparison (XGBoost vs ANN)
